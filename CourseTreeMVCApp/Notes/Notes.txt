We created a MVC Area and the controllers were added using Scaffolding Item.

By default when we create an MVC application we will have Models,Controllers and Views folder.
Similarly when we create an Area will have the same inside the Areas folder for each area we create.
Each Area will have it's own layout view.

=========How to create an Area?=========

1) Right Click on the project 
2) Select Add New Scaffolded Item
3) Then Select the item called "MVC Area"
4) Give Area a name for example "Admin" and then click on Add Button

Once an Area is added make sure to include this code in the Program.cs / Startup.cs(in older versions)

app.MapControllerRoute(
    name: "Admin",
    pattern: "{area:exists}/{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");

Also in the Views folder inside the Areas folder make sure to copy the files "_ViewImports,_ViewStart" and Shared Folder from the common Views folder in MVC project.

====Automatically generate code for CRUD operations in Controllers inside Areas (scaffolding)====

1) Right Click on the Controllers inside the Area folder (ex: Admin Area)
2) Click on the new Scaffolded Item
3) Select "MVC Controller with views,using Entity Framework"
4) Click the Add button 
5) Then select the Model class , suppose if we are going to create category controller then select Category Model.
6) From the Data Context class select the ApplicationDbContext 
7) Then leave all other options as it (Generate Views/Reference script libraries,Use a layout page :- all of them as selected)
8) Finally edit the controller name if required.

Login UserName and Password:-

UserName:- admin@techtree.co.uk
Password:- Password100!

======Creating a partial view=====

Click on the "Shared" Folder and Add New Item
Then Select "Razor View - Empty"
Rename the partial view "_DemoPartial.cshtml"


=======Exceptions======

If we encounter an exception like "An unhandled exception occured while processing the request:- InvalidOperationException: The model item passed into the ViewDataDictionary is of type 'exampleModel' but this ViewDataDictionary instance requires a model item of type 'anotherExampleModel' ".

For this kind of error, make sure to add model (model="new anotherExampleModel) in the respective page like given below:-

 <partial name="_UserLoginPartial" model="new LoginModel
        {
            Email = String.Empty,
            Password = String.Empty,
            RememberMe = false
        }">

==========If Logged In user is not showing any enrolled courses==========

Make sure as an admin, all the category,categoryitem,content and media type is created for the course which the user has enrolled.Else create them first as Admin and then login as the normal user.

==============VideoLink in Content===============

For the video link, use embedded code from youtube.

Example: <iframe width="1263" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w1_AmHv2LmA" title="Part 22 - Display Content - Let&#39;s Build an ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application on .NET 5" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

From this copy the link inside the src, src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w1_AmHv2LmA".

"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w1_AmHv2LmA" this will be the embedded code.

Also we need to add one more thing in this link "https://www.youtube.com/embed/w1_AmHv2LmA?autoplay=1&mute=1" (Add Autoplay ->  ?autoplay=1  and also add &mute=1)
